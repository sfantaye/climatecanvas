ClimateCanvas is an AI-powered, interactive storytelling platform designed to explore climate change data through dynamic visualizations, geospatial insights, and predictive analytics. By combining cutting-edge technologies like Hugging Face's NLP models, geospatial mapping, and machine learning, ClimateCanvas empowers users to uncover meaningful insights about temperature anomalies, CO2 levels, and sea-level rise.

Features
1. Interactive Storytelling
Engage with a narrative-driven exploration of global climate data.
Use sliders, dropdowns, and other widgets to interactively explore trends over time.
2. Geospatial Visualization
Explore regional impacts of climate change using interactive choropleth maps powered by Folium and GeoPandas.
Hover over countries to view temperature anomalies and other metrics.
3. AI-Powered Insights
Generate summaries of selected time periods using Hugging Face's summarization models.
Ask questions in plain English and receive AI-generated answers using question-answering models.
4. Predictive Analytics
Train a simple machine learning model to predict future CO2 levels based on historical trends.
Visualize predictions with dynamic Plotly charts.
5. Secure API Key Management
API keys are securely managed using .env files to protect sensitive information.
